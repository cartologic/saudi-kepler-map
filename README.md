# Saudi COVID-19 map using [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) | [Live demo](https://kepler-covid.mapsaudi.com/)

[![Saudi Kepler's map](docs/imgs/saudi_kepler_map.png "Go to Saudi Kepler's map")](https://kepler-covid.mapsaudi.com/)

This is a react-based map web app built with [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/). It visualizes the data of two layers:
1. [COVID-19 Cases In Saudi Arabia Regions](https://geoportal.tabaqat.net/layers/geonode_data:geonode:covidbyregion) that includes statistics about the total confirmed, deaths, recovered, and active COVID-19 cases for each region.

2. [COVID-19 Cases In Saudi Arabia Governorates](https://geoportal.tabaqat.net/layers/geonode_data:geonode:sagov) that includes the same statistics about COVID-19 but for each governorate located in a specific region.

Check a [live demo](http://kepler-covid.mapsaudi.com/) of the app.

### **How to create a Map app with Kepler.gl**

In this guide, you shall learn how to build and visualize a large amount of location data in your browser using [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

You will be able to perform data analysis in Kepler.gl by adding data to a map, fetching layers from a web service (e.g. [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/)), adding filters, and more cool features to explore.
